A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. These children are also nodes themselves, and each node contains a piece of data. The structure resembles a tree with branches, where each node can have zero, one, or two child nodes.

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a specific type of binary tree in which the nodes are ordered or sorted in a particular way. For any given node in a BST, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than the node's value, and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the node's value. This ordering property allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

Compared to linked lists, which have a time complexity of O(n) for searching, insertion, and deletion in the worst case, binary trees (including BSTs) can offer significant gains in terms of time complexity. In a balanced binary tree (such as a balanced BST), searching, insertion, and deletion operations can have an average time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is much more efficient, especially for large datasets.

The depth of a binary tree is the longest path from the root to a leaf node. The height of a binary tree is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf node. The size of a binary tree is the total number of nodes in the tree.

There are several traversal methods to go through a binary tree:

Inorder Traversal: Visit the left subtree, then the root, then the right subtree.
Preorder Traversal: Visit the root, then the left subtree, then the right subtree.
Postorder Traversal: Visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, then the root.
Level Order Traversal: Visit nodes level by level, starting from the root.
A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible. A full binary tree is a binary tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children. A perfect binary tree is both complete and full, meaning all levels are completely filled, and all nodes have two children, except for the leaf nodes. A balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the height of the two subtrees of any node never differs by more than one.
